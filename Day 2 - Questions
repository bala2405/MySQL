DAY 2: SQL CODING CHALLENGE – DML: 
ONLINE BOOKSTORE 📚
__
Question 1: CREATE TABLE with PRIMARY & FOREIGN KEY
Scenario:
You are creating a database for an online bookstore.
Task:
•    Create a table Books with columns:
o    BookID → INTEGER, PRIMARY KEY
o    Title → VARCHAR(100), NOT NULL
o    Author → VARCHAR(50), NOT NULL
o    ISBN → VARCHAR(20), UNIQUE
o    Price → DECIMAL(8,2), CHECK(Price > 0)
•    Create a table Orders with columns:
o    OrderID → INTEGER, PRIMARY KEY
o    BookID → INTEGER, FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES Books(BookID)
o    OrderDate → DATE, NOT NULL
o    Quantity → INTEGER, CHECK(Quantity > 0)
Expected Output:
Tables are created successfully with all constraints applied.
__
Question 2: ALTER TABLE – Add UNIQUE Constraint
Scenario:
The bookstore wants to make sure ISBN is unique for every book.
Task:
•    Alter the Books table to add a UNIQUE constraint to the ISBN column.
Expected Output:
The ISBN column enforces uniqueness.
__
Question 3: INSERT, RETRIEVE & UPDATE with Constraints
Scenario:
You want to add sample book data and update certain records.
Task:
•    Insert at least 5 records into the Books table, respecting all constraints.
•    Retrieve all records to verify entries.
•    Update the Price or Quantity for a specific record while maintaining the CHECK constraints.
Expected Output:
All entries and updates comply with constraints and are displayed correctly.
__
Question 4: DELETE vs TRUNCATE
Scenario:
The bookstore wants to manage orders by removing some rows or clearing all data.
Task:
•    Use DELETE with a WHERE clause to remove specific rows from Orders table.
•    Use TRUNCATE to remove all rows while keeping table structure intact.
Expected Output:
•    DELETE removes selected rows.
•    TRUNCATE clears all rows quickly but keeps the table structure.
